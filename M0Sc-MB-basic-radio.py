# 
# - An basic exampel of sending A/B key pres on the USB or alternative on radio to another one sending it on USB
#
# See the official MicroPython documentation on: https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
#
# Go together two and two and make one to send on radio (change "local_connected" to True and "name" to a unique
# string. Run programs on both and see what comes through in the shell.
#
# Try to store the program sending on radio onto the MB sending on radio via "save as" in file menu. Store it
# with the name "main.py". Before doing so you must stop the program from within Thonny.
#
# Connect the MB to a battery pack as turn it on. Can you still send/receive..
#
